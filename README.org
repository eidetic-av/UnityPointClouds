#+TITLE: Point Cloud Type and Tools for Unity
* Description
This package provides a ~PointCloud~ type for use in Câ™¯ scrips and inside VFX Graphs.
* Usage
Import this package using Unity's package manager with this git repository.
** VFX Graph
This package provides a VFX Property binder to use PointClouds inside VFX Graphs
by linking the backing Texture2Ds that hold position data and colour data. To
easily use this data inside a graph, the ~PointCloudTexturesSampler~ node is
provided, which takes the backing textures and outputs X,Y,Z and R,G,B data.
** Scripts
To use the ~PointCloud~ type inside a script, import ~Eidetic.PointClouds~ and
instantiate a PointCloud like so:
#+begin_src csharp
PointCloud myPointCloud = PointCloud.Instantiate();
#+end_src
There are multiple ways to set XYZ and RGB data. Have a look inside ~PointCloud.cs~.
* Ply Importer
There is an importer for PLY files included, based off of an importer by keijiro.
Any PLY asset in your project will be imported as a ~PointCloud~.
